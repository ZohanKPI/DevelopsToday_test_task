This is CocktailAdvisorChat utilizing GPT API to get meaningful responses regarding cocktail questions or recommendations. This project can be run locally by installing all the needed dependencies from the requirements.txt file using "pip install -r requirements.txt" command, navigating to the "app" folder and running "uvicorn main:app --reload". After that, proceed to the local link provided in the terminal (http://127.0.0.1:8000 for example) and enter your prompt in the input box. If the interface doesn't load immediately or refuses to connect, wait for a couple of seconds and reload the page. Vector database FAISS asaves preferences mentioned in the user's prompts (processed via LangChain), checks relevant data from Kaggle dataset and enhances future prompts by providing meaningful context, therefore improving the output. Be sure to also provide an OpenAI API key in an .env file in order for the project to run smoothly. If necessary, reach out to me personally for my API key used while developing this project. After testing, one can draw a conclusion that responses are well-structured and influenced by user's saved preferences. I also chose to not use numpy and llama-index mentioned in the task for this implementation, since FAISS's SentenceTransformer requires torch for tensors(hence the amount of torch-related dependencies in requirements.txt) as a way to process data.
